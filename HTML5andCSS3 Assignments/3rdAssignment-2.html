          <h3>Personal life</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a
            sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers:
            Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 - 7 March
            2021)Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995).He was
            extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families
            throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to
            his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never
            owned a television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m.
            and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included his
            books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a
            laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to
            his eldest brother, who survived him.

          <h3>Religious and spiritual views</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Religion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout
            his life. In fact, he made his own spiritual journey the subject of
            his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh
            Swamiji.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Islam</strong></p>
          <p>
            A proud and practising Muslim, daily namaz and fasting during
            Ramadan were integral to Kalam's life. His father, the imam of a
            mosque in his hometown of Rameswaram, had strictly instilled these
            Islamic customs in his children. His father had also impressed upon
            the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue. As
            Kalam recalled: "Every evening, my father A. P. Jainulabdeen, an
            imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy
            Hindu temple, and a church priest used to sit with hot tea and
            discuss the issues concerning the island. Such early exposure
            convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous issues lay
            in "dialogue and cooperation" among the country's religious, social,
            and political leaders.Moreover, since Kalam believed that "respect
            for other faiths" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was
            fond of saying: "For great men, religion is a way of making friends;
            small people make religion a fighting tool."[

          <h3>Writings</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to
            develop India into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation
            by the year 2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons
            programme as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have identified five areas where India has a core competence for
            integrated action: (1) agriculture and food processing; (2)
            education and healthcare; (3) information and communication
            technology; (4) infrastructure, reliable and quality electric power,
            surface transport and infrastructure for all parts of the country;
            and (5) self-reliance in critical technologies. These five areas are
            closely inter-related and if advanced in a coordinated way, will
            lead to food, economic and national security.
